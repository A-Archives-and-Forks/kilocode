## 1. Overview of Changes

- **Files Added:**
    - `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts`
    - `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/__tests__/fixtures/remove/single-file.ts`
    - `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/__tests__/remove.test.ts`
- **Files Modified:**
    - `src/core/tools/refactor-code/engine.ts`
    - `src/core/tools/refactor-code/utils/symbol-finder.ts`
    - `src/core/tools/refactor-code/utils/__tests__/symbol-finder.test.ts`
- **Files Deleted:** None
- **High-Level Purpose:** Implement the REMOVE operation for the TypeScript refactoring tool, fix issues in the SymbolFinder utility, and update the engine to use the actual implementation.

## 2. Clean-Code Checks

1. **[`src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts:56-78`](src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts:56-78)** – _Duplicated Snapshot Logic_

    - **Description:** The code takes a snapshot at line 44, but then takes additional snapshots at line 66 when modifying exports. This could lead to unnecessary snapshots.
    - **Recommendation:** Consider taking a single snapshot at the beginning of the operation.

2. **[`src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts:80-107`](src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts:80-107)** – _Early Return Pattern_

    - **Description:** The early return for exported variables creates a separate code path with duplicated logic.
    - **Recommendation:** Consider restructuring to avoid the early return and maintain a single flow through the function.

3. **[`src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts:139-147`](src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/remove.ts:139-147)** – _Empty Undo Function_

    - **Description:** The undo function is empty with a comment indicating it relies on file snapshots.
    - **Recommendation:** Consider adding a more explicit comment explaining why the function is empty or implement proper undo logic.

4. **[`src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/__tests__/remove.test.ts:48-85`](src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/__tests__/remove.test.ts:48-85)** – _Test Structure_
    - **Description:** The test verifies multiple aspects (function removal and export removal) in a single test case.
    - **Recommendation:** Consider splitting into separate test cases for clearer failure isolation.

## 3. Testing Integrity

- **Test Suite Status:** Passed
- **Failing Tests (if any):** None
- **Coverage Impact:** Improved (added tests for new REMOVE operation)
- **Recommendations:**
    1. Add tests for removing other symbol types (enums, interfaces, type aliases)
    2. Add tests for removing symbols with references in other files
    3. Consider adding tests for edge cases like removing the last export in a file

## 4. Architecture & Consistency

- **Duplicated Logic:** Some duplication between handling different types of nodes in the remove operation
- **Unused Imports / Dead Code:** None found
- **Naming Conventions:** Consistent with existing codebase

## 5. Security & Error Handling

- **Hard-coded Secrets:** None found
- **Improper Error Handling:**
    1. The error handling in the catch block is generic and could be more specific
    2. The operation doesn't check if the symbol is removable before attempting to remove it

## 6. Next Actions (Prioritized)

1. Refactor the snapshot logic to avoid taking multiple snapshots of the same file
2. Improve error handling to check if symbols are removable before attempting removal
3. Add tests for additional symbol types and cross-file references
4. Implement the MOVE operation following the same pattern as RENAME and REMOVE
