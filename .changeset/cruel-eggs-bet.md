- A visual indication is now included in the task view whenever Morph is used.
- The traditional file editing tools are now disabled to ensure Morph is used to edit files.
- Morph is now automatically disabled when the API provider does not support it and no Morph API key is configured.
- The Morph API key is no longer lost when switching provider profiles.
