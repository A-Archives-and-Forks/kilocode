Let's test the move operation with our recent file path fixes. Please run this specific test operation:

```typescript
<refactor_code>
<operations>
[
  {
    "operation": "move",
    "selector": {
      "type": "identifier",
      "name": "getUserData",
      "kind": "function",
      "filePath": "examples/src/services/userService.ts"
    },
    "targetFilePath": "examples/src/services/profileService.ts",
    "reason": "Testing path resolution in move operations"
  }
]
</operations>
</refactor_code>
```

IMPORTANT: WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE TASK ABOVE, YOU MUST EXPLICITLY CALL THE FOLLOWING MCP TOOL:

use_mcp_tool(
  server_name: "kilo-dev-mcp-server",
  tool_name: "stop_dev_extension",
  arguments: {
    "sessionId": "test-6b8zy2ve"
  }
)

Session ID: test-6b8zy2ve

This will signal that you have finished the task and allow the system to continue.
DO NOT FORGET to call this tool when you are done. The system will remain blocked until you do.
