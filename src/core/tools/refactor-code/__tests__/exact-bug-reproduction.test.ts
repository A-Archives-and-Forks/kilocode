/**
 * Exact Bug Reproduction Test
 *
 * This test reproduces the exact scenario described in the bug report:
 * - Complex batch operation with 17 operations (2 renames, 2 moves, 3 renames, 10 removes)
 * - Operation 4 (move calculateTotalPrice to product-utils.ts) fails with naming conflict
 * - Despite target file being empty before the batch operation
 *
 * Bug Report: local-prompts/test-results/bugreport.md
 * Root Cause: Pre-population race condition in batch processing logic
