/**
 * Test for automatic rollback functionality in RefactorCodeTool
 *
 * This test verifies that when batch operations fail, the system automatically
 * restores files to their original state without requiring user intervention.
 *
 * Key Requirements:
 * - Files should never be left in a partial state
 * - Automatic rollback should be seamless to users
 * - No manual intervention required for restoration
