# Free Tokens for New Users

When you sign up for Kilo Code, you'll receive **<FreeTierAmount /> worth of tokens for free** to help you get started. To claim your free tokens:

1. Complete the registration process
2. You should recieve $5 or $20 in free tokens to use immediately 
3. To recieve the full $20 for free, you may need to enter your credit card (used for identity verification purposes)

## Payment Methods

Once you've used your initial free tokens, you can easily add more:

- Add a credit card to your account (all payments are securely processed through Stripe)
- We don't currently offer a subscription, so you only pay for the tokens you use, and only when you choose to top up your tokens!
- Leverage your own API provider by [connecting your own API provider](/getting-started/connecting-api-provider.md)

## Transparent Pricing

At Kilo Code, we believe in complete pricing transparency:

- Our pricing matches the model provider's API rates exactly
- We don't take any commission or markup, either per token or per top-up
- You only pay for what you use with no hidden fees

## Future Plans

We're continuously working to improve Kilo Code and expand our offerings:

- Additional LLM providers will be added in the future
- More payment options and subscription plans are under development
