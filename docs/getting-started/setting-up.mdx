# Setting up Kilo Code

When you sign up for Kilo Code, you'll receive **free credits** to help you get started. To claim your credits:

1. Complete the registration process - you'll receive an initial amount of free credits to use immediately
2. To unlock additional credits (up to <FreeTierAmount /> total):
    * add a payment method for identity verification
    * authorize Kilo Code to place a _temporary_ $10 hold on your card
3. As long as this payment method hasn't been used to claim free credits through a different Kilo Code account before, you can enjoy your free tokens and start coding right away!

:::note About the temporary hold
To keep our service reliable and prevent misuse, we place a _temporary_ $10 hold on your credit card during verification. Here's what you need to know:

- **It's not a charge** - This is a temporary authorization that will not be charged to your account
- **Bank processing time** - The hold is automatically released after 7 days. After release, it may take **up to 2 more weeks** (5-10 business days) for funds to return to your account. This varies by bank.
- **How it's displayed** - Some banks may show this as a regular transaction, but it remains a temporary hold
- **Tracking available** - After the hold is released (7 days), we can provide a STAN tracking number to help you track the refund with your bank if needed.
