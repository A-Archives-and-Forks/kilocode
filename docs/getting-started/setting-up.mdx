# Setting up Kilo Code

When you sign up for Kilo Code, you'll receive **<FreeTierAmount /> worth of tokens for free** to help you get started. To claim your free tokens:

1. Complete the registration process
2. You should recieve $5 or $20 in free tokens to use immediately 
3. To recieve the full <FreeTierAmount /> for free, you need to enter your credit card (used for identity verification purposes)

:::note About the temporary hold
To protect our community and ensure service quality, we temporarily place a $10 hold on your credit card during registration. This hold typically lasts about a week and **will not be charged** to your account. We've implemented this measure to prevent abuse of our free tier while ensuring legitimate users have the best possible experience. We're actively working to remove this limitation in the future.
