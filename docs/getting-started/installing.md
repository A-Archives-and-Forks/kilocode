# Installing Kilo Code

Kilo Code is a VS Code extension that brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your editor. Install using one of these methods:
1. **VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)** - fastest method for standard VS Code and Cursor users
1. **Open VSX Registry** - for VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium
1. **Manually install the .vsix file** - direct installation from the GitHub Release

## VS Code Marketplace

2. Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS)
