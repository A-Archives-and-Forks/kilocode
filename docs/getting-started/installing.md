# Installing Kilo Code

Kilo Code is a VS Code extension that brings AI-powered coding assistance directly to your editor. Install using one of these methods:
1. **VS Code Marketplace (Recommended)** - fastest method for standard VS Code and Cursor users
2. **Open VSX Registry** - for VS Code-compatible editors like VSCodium

## VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS)
3. Search for "Kilo Code"
4. Select "Kilo Code" by Kilo Code and click **Install**
5. Reload VS Code if prompted

After installation, find the Kilo Code icon (<Codicon name="rocket" />) in the Activity Bar to open the Kilo Code panel.
