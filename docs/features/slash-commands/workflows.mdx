Workflows allow you to define a series of steps to guide Kilo Code through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or submitting a PR.

To invoke a workflow, type `/[workflow-name.md]` in the chat.

## How to Create and Use Workflows

Workflows live alongside [Kilo Code Rules](/advanced-usage/custom-rules). Creating one is straightforward:

1. Create a markdown file with clear instructions for the steps Kilo Code should take
2. Save it with a `.md` extension in your workflows directory `.kilocode/workflows`. Global workflows go in your home directory, workspace workflows in your workspace.
3. To trigger a workflow, just type `/` followed by the workflow filename
4. Provide any required parameters when prompted

The real power comes from how you structure your workflow files. You can:

-   Leverage Kilo Code's [built-in tools](/features/tools/tool-use-overview) like `ask_followup_question`, `read_file`, `search_files`, and `new_task`
-   Use command-line tools you already have installed like `gh` or `docker`
-   Reference external [MCP tool calls](/features/mcp/overview) like Slack or Whatsapp
-   Chain multiple actions together in a specific sequence

## Real-world Example



## Building Your Own Workflows

The beauty of workflows is they're completely customizable to your needs. You might create workflows for all kinds of repetitive tasks:

-   For releases, you could have a workflow that grabs all merged PRs, builds a changelog, and handles version bumps.
-   Setting up new projects is perfect for workflows. Just run one command to create your folder structure, install dependencies, and set up configs.
-   Need to create a report? Create a workflow that grabs stats from different sources and formats them exactly how you like. You can even visualize them with a charting library and then make a presentation out of it with a library like [slidev](https://sli.dev/).
-   You can even use workflows to draft messages to your team using an MCP server like Slack or Whatsapp after you submit a PR.

With Workflows, your imagination is the limit. The true potential comes from spotting those annoying repetitive tasks you do all the time.

If you can describe something as "first I do X, then Y, then Z" - that's a perfect workflow candidate.

Start with something small that bugs you, turn it into a workflow, and keep refining it. You'll be shocked how much of your day can be automated this way.
