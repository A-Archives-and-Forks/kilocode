Workflows allow you to define a series of steps to guide Kilo Code through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or submitting a PR.

To invoke a workflow, type `/[workflow-name.md]` in the chat.

## How to Create and Use Workflows

Workflows live alongside [Kilo Code Rules](/advanced-usage/custom-rules). Creating one is straightforward:

1. Create a markdown file with clear instructions for the steps Kilo Code should take
2. Save it with a `.md` extension in your workflows directory `.kilocode/workflows`. Global workflows go in your home directory, workspace workflows in your workspace.
3. To trigger a workflow, just type `/` followed by the workflow filename
4. Provide any required parameters when prompted

The real power comes from how you structure your workflow files. You can:

-   Leverage Kilo Code's [built-in tools](/features/tools/tool-use-overview) like `ask_followup_question`, `read_file`, `search_files`, and `new_task`
-   Use command-line tools you already have installed like `gh` or `docker`
-   Reference external [MCP tool calls](/features/mcp/overview) like Slack or Whatsapp
-   Chain multiple actions together in a specific sequence

## Real-world Example

Let's walk through creating a workflow for submitting a pull request. This workflow handles the entire process from code review to deployment notification.

Create a file called `submit-pr.md` in your `.kilocode/workflows` directory:

```markdown
# Submit PR Workflow

You are helping submit a pull request. Follow these steps:

1. First, use `search_files` to check for any TODO comments or console.log statements that shouldn't be committed
2. Run tests using `execute_command` with `npm test` or the appropriate test command
3. If tests pass, stage and commit changes with a descriptive commit message
4. Push the branch and create a pull request using `gh pr create`
5. Use `ask_followup_question` to get the PR title and description from the user
6. After creating the PR, use the Slack MCP tool to notify the team channel
7. Finally, use `new_task` in architect mode to plan any follow-up deployment steps

Parameters needed:
- Branch name (ask if not provided)
- Target branch (default to 'main')
- Reviewers to assign
```

Now you can trigger this workflow by typing `/submit-pr.md` in the chat. Kilo Code will:

- Scan your code for common issues before committing
- Run your test suite to catch problems early
- Handle the Git operations and PR creation
- Notify your team automatically
- Set up follow-up tasks for deployment

This saves you from manually running the same 7-step process every time you want to submit code for review.


## Building Your Own Workflows

The beauty of workflows is they're completely customizable to your needs. You might create workflows for all kinds of repetitive tasks:

-   For releases, you could have a workflow that grabs all merged PRs, builds a changelog, and handles version bumps.
-   Setting up new projects is perfect for workflows. Just run one command to create your folder structure, install dependencies, and set up configs.
-   Need to create a report? Create a workflow that grabs stats from different sources and formats them exactly how you like. You can even visualize them with a charting library and then make a presentation out of it with a library like [slidev](https://sli.dev/).
-   You can even use workflows to draft messages to your team using an MCP server like Slack or Whatsapp after you submit a PR.

With Workflows, your imagination is the limit. The true potential comes from spotting those annoying repetitive tasks you do all the time.

If you can describe something as "first I do X, then Y, then Z" - that's a perfect workflow candidate.

Start with something small that bugs you, turn it into a workflow, and keep refining it. You'll be shocked how much of your day can be automated this way.
