# Refactor Code Tool: Detailed Task Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines specific tasks to address the architectural and functional issues identified in the refactor code tool. Each task is designed to be independently assigned and executed, with clear starting points and success criteria.

The primary issues to address are:

1. **Deprecated components** that need replacement
2. **Path resolution inconsistencies** causing failures
3. **Import handling limitations** affecting move operations
4. **Error handling weaknesses** in various operations
5. **Code organization** that needs consolidation

## Phase 1: Path Resolution Standardization

**Context**: Path handling inconsistencies are causing test failures and unreliable behavior. The `resolveFilePath` function is deprecated but still widely used, while the newer `PathResolver` class exists but isn't fully adopted.

### Task 1.1: Update `RefactorEngine` Path Handling

**Description**: Refactor the `RefactorEngine` class to use `PathResolver` exclusively for all path operations.

**Steps**:

1. Add a `PathResolver` instance as a class property in `RefactorEngine`
2. Replace all calls to the deprecated `resolveFilePath` with `pathResolver.resolveAbsolutePath`
3. Standardize path normalization with `pathResolver.normalizeFilePath`
4. Update the diagnostic function to use `PathResolver`

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/engine.ts`

**Success Criteria**:

- No more usage of the deprecated `resolveFilePath` function in `engine.ts`
- All path operations use the `PathResolver` instance consistently
- Tests for the engine continue to pass

### Task 1.2: Fix Path Resolution in MoveOrchestrator

**Description**: Address path resolution issues in the `MoveOrchestrator` class that are causing test failures.

**Steps**:

1. Review how `MoveOrchestrator` uses paths and ensure consistent normalization
2. Fix path handling in the verification step (`verifyMoveOperation` method)
3. Ensure paths in `affectedFiles` are properly normalized and consistent
4. Improve path error reporting to aid debugging

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/MoveOrchestrator.ts`

**Success Criteria**:

- The `moveOperation.test.ts` passes consistently
- `affectedFiles` paths are properly normalized and consistent
- Diagnostic logs show correct path handling

## Phase 2: Import Management Enhancement

**Context**: When moving functions between files, the necessary imports aren't properly transferred, leading to compilation errors.

### Task 2.1: Enhance Import Analysis

**Description**: Improve the import analysis to better detect dependencies when moving code.

**Steps**:

1. Enhance `SymbolExtractor` to analyze and extract all imports needed by a symbol
2. Add dependency tracking for type references and variables
3. Implement better handling of nested type references
4. Add tests for import extraction with complex dependencies

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/core/SymbolExtractor.ts`
- Add/update tests in `__tests__` directory

**Success Criteria**:

- Type imports are properly carried over during move operations
- Nested type dependencies are correctly identified
- Tests pass for complex dependency scenarios

### Task 2.2: Update Import Transfer Logic

**Description**: Fix how imports are transferred during move operations.

**Steps**:

1. Improve the import transfer logic in `MoveOrchestrator.extractAndAddSymbol`
2. Ensure imports are properly added to the target file
3. Handle duplicate imports and prevent redundancy
4. Fix relative path adjustments for moved imports

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/MoveOrchestrator.ts`
- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/utils/import-manager.ts`

**Success Criteria**:

- The `"import { UserProfile } from"` is properly added to target files
- Imports maintain correct relative paths after moving
- No duplicate imports are created

## Phase 3: Error Handling Improvements

**Context**: Some operations report success even when internal steps fail, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Task 3.1: Refine Success/Failure Reporting

**Description**: Improve how operations report success or failure to ensure consistency.

**Steps**:

1. Review and fix the error handling in `MoveOrchestrator.executeMoveOperation`
2. Ensure symbol removal failures are properly propagated
3. Standardize error message formats for better diagnostics
4. Fix the success/failure logic in the verification step

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/MoveOrchestrator.ts`
- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/engine.ts`

**Success Criteria**:

- Operations accurately report their true success/failure status
- Error messages provide clear, actionable information
- Logs show consistent error handling patterns

### Task 3.2: Add Robust Validation and Recovery

**Description**: Enhance validation steps and add recovery mechanisms for common failures.

**Steps**:

1. Add more comprehensive validation before executing operations
2. Implement recovery strategies for common failure modes
3. Add better diagnostic information for validation failures
4. Ensure temporary files are cleaned up after failures

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/engine.ts`
- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/MoveOrchestrator.ts`
- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/RemoveOrchestrator.ts`

**Success Criteria**:

- More issues are caught during validation before execution
- Recovery mechanisms handle common failure scenarios
- Error messages provide clear steps to resolve issues

## Phase 4: Deprecated Code Removal

**Context**: Several components are marked as deprecated but still in use, creating confusion and maintenance challenges.

### Task 4.1: Replace Deprecated Functions

**Description**: Replace all deprecated functions with their modern equivalents.

**Steps**:

1. Replace the deprecated `executeMoveOperation` in `move.ts` with direct calls to `MoveOrchestrator`
2. Remove the deprecated `resolveFilePath` function and update all callers
3. Update all relevant import statements and references
4. Add deprecated notices to any functions that cannot be immediately removed

**Files to modify**:

- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/operations/move.ts`
- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/utils/file-system.ts`
- Various files that use deprecated functions

**Success Criteria**:

- No more calls to deprecated functions
- All functionality maintained with modern implementations
- No deprecation warnings in logs

### Task 4.2: Update API Documentation

## Priority Order and Dependencies

1. **Phase 1** (Path Resolution): Should be completed first as it affects all other functionality
2. **Phase 3** (Error Handling): High priority as it improves reliability
3. **Phase 2** (Import Management): Needed to fix the failing tests completely
4. **Phase 4** (Deprecated Code): Can be done after the core functionality is stable
5. **Phase 5** (Code Organization): Improves maintainability but doesn't affect functionality
6. **Phase 6** (Testing): Should be done incrementally alongside other changes

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Path Resolution)
- **Week 2**: Complete Phase 3 (Error Handling) and start Phase 2 (Import Management)
- **Week 3**: Complete Phase 2 and start Phase 4 (Deprecated Code)
- **Week 4**: Complete Phase 4 and start Phase 5 (Code Organization)
- **Week 5**: Complete Phase 5 and Phase 6 (Testing)

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this refactoring plan:

1. The codebase will be more maintainable with clear separation of concerns
2. Path handling will be consistent and reliable
3. Move operations will properly handle dependencies and imports
4. Error handling will be more robust and informative
5. Tests will provide better coverage and reliability
6. No deprecated code will remain in the codebase

This will result in a more reliable, maintainable, and extensible refactoring tool that meets the needs of its users.
